# Timestamp Microservice

The user can pass a string as parameter, and the app will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date.

If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it will return null for those properties.
