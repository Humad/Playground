# Project Playground

This repository contains projects that I don't actively maintain. These are projects that I have worked on to learn new concepts or to play around with some new ideas.

Currently, the repo includes Android, iOS, Nodejs, Django, and C++ applications. 

# Android 
1. [Greedy Scheduler](https://github.com/Humad/Project-Playground/tree/master/Android/GreedyScheduler): 
A scheduling application that uses a greedy algorithm to create an optimal schedule. 
Created this just to put a greedy algorithm into practice.

2. [Shake Detector](https://github.com/Humad/Project-Playground/tree/master/Android/ShakeDetector): 
An application that gets sensor data to determine if the phone is being shaken.
I wanted to test phone sensors.

3. [Udacity Projects](https://github.com/Humad/Project-Playground/tree/master/Android/UdacityProjects): 
A number of projects from the Udacity Android App Development course. 
These are just beginner projects that I worked on when first creating Android applications.

# C++
1. Breadth-first Search: 
A simple BFS implementation using C++.

2. Functional Programming: 
Experimenting with functional programming for fun.

3. Imagemasks: 
Working with the CImg library to create different image masks.

4. Malloc: 
Implementing memory allocation.

5. Optimized Fountain: 
Simulating a fountain and using compiler optimizations to make it run faster.

6. Rapidly Exploring Random Tree: 
Creating RRTs to find a path in a maze.

7. Scheduler: 
Implementing process scheduling algorithms (STCF, Round Robin etc).

# Django
1. Skeleton: 
A simple skeleton app for starting a Django application.

# iOS
1. MemeMe: 
Create memes using images.

2. Pitch Perfect: 
Modify properties of a recording to make it sound different.

# Node.js

Gives information about an uploaded file.

2. Header Parser Microservice: 
Gives information about the user using the HTTP request header.

3. Mongoose Transactions: 
Basic Get/Insert/Update/Delete operations using Mongoose.

4. Passport Vault: 
Authenticating users using Passport.

5. Timestamp Microservice: 
Simple date/time conversion.

6. URL Shortener:
