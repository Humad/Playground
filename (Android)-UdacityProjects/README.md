# Udacity Android Projects

This repository contains Android App Development projects as part of multiple Udacity courses. 

These projects range from very basic beginner applications to more advanced ones. 

As I continue to work through the Udacity courses, I will update this repository and add new projects.

So far, the projects contained in this repository are:

1. # Birthday card : A very basic single-page application that makes use of the Relative Layout view group. This is the first application I made, and is part of the [Android Development for Beginners](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-development-for-beginners--ud837) course on Udacity.
