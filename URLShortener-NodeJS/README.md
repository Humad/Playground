# URL Shortener

URL Shortener Microservice - [Live Version](https://xvi.herokuapp.com/)  

Allows users to input a URL, and get a shortened URL in return, which will redirect to the original URL. In my case, my original URL is long, it often ends up returning a longer URL than the original input. Perhaps one day I'll move on from the free Heroku plan and fix this.

This is a [FreeCodeCamp Project](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/url-shortener-microservice)
